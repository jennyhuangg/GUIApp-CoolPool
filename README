We implemented a two-player turn based 8-ball pool game. Each player can control 
the direction and power of the cue stick to hit the balls on the pool table. The goal 
of the game is to be the first to pocket all of either the striped or solid balls and 
then pocket the black 8-ball. The player who does that first wins.
